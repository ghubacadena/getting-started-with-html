<h2>How the Internet works?</h2>
<p align="justify">Even though it seems pure magic, what is really behind is just a formal procedure to establish a straightforward communication between your computer and a web server. As in the ancient times when an embassador went to another kingdom to meet the king, an elaborate protocol where established to keep the relations between both nations in proper manner. Something similar happens when you try to access a web page throughout the internet. A specific <abbr title="The protocol used is HTTP"><b>protocol</b></abbr> is followed by the computers to get and fetch the page that you are requesting. In the next image the basic steps to ask and retrieve a web page are depicted.

<p align="center"><img src="./Images/Actors in the Web.jpg" alt="Actors in the Web" align="middle" width="900" height="400"></p>
<hr>
<p align="justify">The flow goes form left to right and comes back. The actors, by order of appearance are: the <abbr title="The User is You and the browser"><b>User</b></abbr>, the <b>Internet</b> and the <b>web Servers</b>.<br>
The series of steps followed to retreive a web page are:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Everything starts when you "feed" an URL in the browser</li>
<li>The URL is resolved by the Internet and a request is sent to the Server which has the page stored</li>
<li>The Server sends back a response with the web page (a HTML document)</li>
<li>The Internet redirects the document directly to your computer</li>
<li>The browser displays the web page on the screen</li>
</ol>
