<h2>My own story about HTML</h2>
<p align="justify">The story starts when you, after some time of hard work finally get a chance for an interview for your ideal job. The interview will be in your home and you are planning a formal dinner to close the deal but you forgot that you need to finish a report for your boss and don’t have much time to set everything for the dinner to make the good impression you want, so now you has to figure it out how resolve the mess.
</p>
<p align="justify">Almost at the point you’re in panic, remember that your “bro” (don’t be confuse, not your brother, your browser), is available and he can help you setting the table for you. But there is a little problem, he doesn’t know much about politeness and you can’t afford the minimum error, everything has to be perfect! 
</p>
<p align="justify">First, you thought write a precisely instruction manual for your “bro” but you remember he’s not a good reader too - at this point you are thinking your “bro” is stupid - the only thing he’s good enough is solving puzzle. There’s when you got the idea about HTML (Help me with This Mess pLease).
A simple way to tell your “bro” what he has to do to set the table. Using small pieces of information, such as tags, to name everything you needs on the table, for example you use &lt;c&gt; for candle, &lt;w&gt; for wine, &lt;f&gt; for fork, etc.
</p>
<p align="justify">To avoid creates a bunch of tags, one for red wine or white candle, you use attributes to specify that kind of information, for example &lt;t type=”round”&gt; for round table. At the end you has already created a nice and smooth system to tell your “bro” how he has to set the table, moreover you realize that the system can be used to set any kind of table for any kind of dinner.
</p>
<p align="justify">By the way, when you arrive everything is done, the interview was perfect and got the job. But when you thought to share with the world about your nice system, you realize that someone else has already created HTML and use a showy name for that, “HyperText Markup Language” ….. Ha!
